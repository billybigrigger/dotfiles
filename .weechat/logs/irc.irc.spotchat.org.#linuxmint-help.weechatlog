It's a dual boot with Windows, and I noticed the Mint listing in the grub boot menu was "Linux Mint with 3.2.0 -23-generic" instead of Linux Mint 13 like I was expecting.  Any ideas what went wrong?

2013-10-27 20:45:56	gbvoris_web	Then click the "Recommended repair" button. When repair is finished, note the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX) that appeared on a paper, then reboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs. If the repair did not succeed, indicate the URL to people who help you by email or forum.
