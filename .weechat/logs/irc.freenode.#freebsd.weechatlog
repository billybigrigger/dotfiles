2013-10-18 01:40:37	tigersharke	easy enough, svn update inside of /usr/src, then within the version you desire, you'd do your make buildworld and make buildkernel, then make installworld, make installkernel, then reboot.
2013-10-18 01:41:19	tigersharke	that is not the only or best way but it is what I have done, to get from PC-BSD v9.1, to effectively FreeBSD 9.2, and now FreeBSD 10-beta1

2013-10-18 01:42:51	tigersharke	as for what is considered STABLE, that branch may change over time. It had been v9.2 prior to it becoming release.  I am uncertain how things progress in that regard.

2013-10-18 01:55:04	IAmTheClaw	probably not a big deal on patch or even minor updates, but could screw things up between userland and kernel for major updates
2013-10-18 01:56:02	tigersharke	IAmTheClaw: so far no troubles here, but I have been working from console rather than an xterm or other situation. And I did say that how I have been doing things is not the best/only way :)
2013-10-18 01:56:41	tigersharke	or perhaps I should say that no troubles known to be caused by my way.
2013-10-18 01:57:15	IAmTheClaw	there is a whole page on the process in the handbook that does get updated
2013-10-18 01:57:48	IAmTheClaw	always best to point people to that rather than going by memory of what you do :P
2013-10-18 01:58:58	tigersharke	of course.. and I don't consider myself the last word here.
2013-10-18 01:59:29	tigersharke	if I say something wrong, I basically assume I will be corrected. :D

2013-10-18 08:16:56	wonko	and a pkg upgrade wants to do silly things like install apache22 even though apache24 is installed and then blows up

2013-10-18 14:34:20	AllanJude	Prock81: if you want a mirror: mirror disk1 disk2
2013-10-18 14:34:27	Prock81	AllanJude so if i only have one disk what would i put? stripe?
2013-10-18 14:34:30	AllanJude	Prock81: if you want RAID-Z1: raidz1 disk1 disk2 disk3 disk4
2013-10-18 14:34:30	AllanJude	etc
2013-10-18 14:34:32	ljvb	its just the racoon setup I just started working on 2 hours ago that is not working
2013-10-18 14:34:40	AllanJude	Prock81: for 1 disk, but no word, then just the disk
2013-10-18 14:34:41	ghoti	AllanJude: also, you may be confusing scrub with resilver.  A resilver checks data that have not been checked yet.  scrub checks everything.
2013-10-18 14:35:01	AllanJude	ghoti: a resilver rewrites data on a new/replaced drive
2013-10-18 14:35:09	Prock81	AllanJude huh?
2013-10-18 14:35:30	Prock81	what do u mean but no word
2013-10-18 14:35:30	ljvb	Cpt-Oblivious the reality is, I do not need l2tp, I spend my entire week (every week till 2015) travelling for work, I have a new tivo whcih supports streaming, but requires the devices to be on the same network :( hence the need for bridged vpn vs routed
2013-10-18 14:35:32	AllanJude	ghoti: ZFS will do the checksum check on every time, every time it is read. it will detect 'cosmic bit rot' etc. but if a file is never read, it can't be detected, hense the scrub
2013-10-18 14:35:46	AllanJude	prock81: you put NOTHING, just: zpool create <poolname> <diskname>
2013-10-18 14:35:54	Cpt-Oblivious	ljvb: http://pastebin.com/0m4NDYWb <- this is my racoon config, I don't use l2tp either.
2013-10-18 14:36:07	 *	ljvb looks
2013-10-18 14:36:19	AllanJude	ghoti: sorry, ... on every FILE, every time it is read...
2013-10-18 14:36:30	AllanJude	well, it checks the blocks that are read, not the entire file, but
2013-10-18 14:36:32	AllanJude	you get the idea
2013-10-18 14:36:54	Prock81	AllanJude zpool create -o altroot=/mnt -O canmount=off -m none zroot
2013-10-18 14:37:00	AllanJude	ZFS verifies the checksum of every block, every single time that block is read from the disk. so if you "use" all of your files frequently, the scrub is not always an advantage
2013-10-18 14:37:02	Prock81	AllanJude and not the rest?
2013-10-18 14:37:17	AllanJude	Prock81: fuck you are dumb. just don't put a keyword (mirror, raidz1, etc) and that makes it a stripe

2013-10-21 00:00:00	billybigrigger	hey all
2013-10-21 00:00:06	billybigrigger	is there a problem with the ports tree?
2013-10-21 00:00:30	billybigrigger	i can't seem to fetch it on 10.0 beta, i get an error after extracting, when its verifying the snap
2013-10-21 00:01:29	billybigrigger	i've tried to rm -f /usr/local/portsnap and try again, but i keep getting the same error over and over, i've even re-installed on 3 different fresh vm's and get the same error
2013-10-21 00:01:29	blakkheim	how about reading what we told you to do in the other channel instead of asking here again
2013-10-21 00:01:58	billybigrigger	why is the snapshot corrupt?
2013-10-21 00:02:22	billybigrigger	and what did you tell me to do that i didnt do?

2013-10-21 00:03:38	billybigrigger	no
2013-10-21 00:05:16	billybigrigger	nuked the portsnap dir, trying again
2013-10-21 00:06:28	billybigrigger	blakkheim: point me to a mirror i can try
2013-10-21 00:06:50	billybigrigger	i've tried portsnap1.freebsd.org all the way through portsnap5
2013-10-21 00:06:59	billybigrigger	crest: still corrupt
2013-10-21 00:07:26	crest	i have no problem i just updated the portstree
2013-10-21 00:07:49	crest	but given that portsnap includes it's own cdn logic their could be a corrupted mirror

Currently I'm using KVM to run a bunch of VM's, and it is fast and easy. Is KVM just as good under FreeBSD, or should I look elsewhere?  :)

2013-10-21 01:26:09	ThomasLocke	xmj, I need the GNAT GPL compiler from AdaCore. AFAIK it does not run on FreeBSD. I can get the dragonlace stuff, but that is missing some key components.
2013-10-21 01:26:21	xmj	huh.

2013-10-21 01:27:21	ThomasLocke	But it is good to know that bhyve will have Linux support from launch. Thanks.
2013-10-21 01:27:23	aek	I think gnat is the fsf version and gnat-aux the bsd/dragonlance version.
2013-10-21 01:27:33	AllanJude	xmj: i do not know. i think if it did, you'd have no video on the host, which might be an issue
2013-10-21 01:27:53	ThomasLocke	aek, Yea, and neither do what I need them to do. Sadly.
2013-10-21 01:27:56	AllanJude	ThomasLocke: the ADA/GNAT stuff was just fixed

2013-10-21 01:29:45	AllanJude	I forget, I don't even know what any of it is, I just remember reading about fixing ADA/GNAT in the status report today
2013-10-21 01:29:49	ThomasLocke	There are some tools in the AdaCore GNAT GPL compiler that are not available in the FSF version.
2013-10-21 01:30:07	ThomasLocke	You got a link AllanJude?  :)
2013-10-21 01:30:10	frogs	are there multiple independent projects all calling themselves "gnat"?

2013-10-21 01:34:55	LSD`	that said, there a plenty of places you can be using Linux, but jsut not realise it - which also isn't a bad thing
2013-10-21 01:35:13	AllanJude	i am hoping to replace the 2 centos boxes that are poluting my otherwise freebsd only shop (70+ boxes) with bhyve. if they ever get a 64bit linuxulator, i might be able to run the app native
2013-10-21 01:35:37	AllanJude	xmj: Jamie is cool, but i am not sure i'd consider him an expert on that subject
2013-10-21 01:35:40	xmj	i love how people consider running something in linuxulator 'native' :-)
2013-10-21 01:35:58	AllanJude	xmj: it is native, not emulated, just translating system calls
2013-10-21 01:36:00	serpentine	its close enough
2013-10-21 01:36:05	xmj	right
2013-10-21 01:36:10	AllanJude	it isn't running linux

2013-10-21 01:55:55	AllanJude	i have not used it much
2013-10-21 01:56:01	AllanJude	but i think it even takes care of 'aging' etc
2013-10-21 01:56:19	AllanJude	so when you send a customer their 2nd invoice, it shows what they owe / have paid from the first etc
2013-10-21 01:57:01	xmj	integrated with banking?!
2013-10-21 01:57:04	xmj	nice

2013-10-21 03:35:40	elmargol	HI I'm wondering how do i replace perl 5.12 -> perl 5.14?
2013-10-21 03:35:46	elmargol	I'm using portmater
2013-10-21 03:36:04	Maff	portmaster should be able to upgrade it for you
2013-10-21 03:36:27	digitalist	Yeah I'm going through that, but it seems (unless I'm missing something) that I'd have to go through individual projects to find "wanted" notices, although the PR database exists
2013-10-21 03:37:27	elmargol	guess i install the new port and rebuild all depending ports?

2013-10-21 03:38:10	Maff	once you update your local ports tree via portsnap, you should be able to just do 'portmaster -a' and it'll update any out-of-date ports. If you specifically want to update perl and nothing else, portmaster lang/perl5.14 should do it
2013-10-21 03:38:39	elmargol	Maff, if i do portmaster -a i get the deprication warning thats why im asking
2013-10-21 03:39:04	Maff	deprecation warning?
2013-10-21 03:39:19	Maff	there wasn't a deprecation warning when I upgraded iirc, but 5.14 came out ages ago
2013-10-21 03:40:44	elmargol	This port is marked DEPRECATED
2013-10-21 03:40:49	elmargol	===>>> Update for perl-5.12.5 failed
2013-10-21 03:41:11	Maff	oh, if you just build lang/perl5.14 then you -should- be alright there as it'll remove the older version of perl

2013-10-21 06:46:42	aicasn	hi all - i need a little help debugging a serial port. this machine has a 6-port win627uhg controller. when any of the 6 ports are written to, the port blocks. i believe the port was set up correctly, but here's the termios code: http://pastie.org/private/spbi0w8frrfz9yp0cy1wyw
2013-10-21 06:47:00	mmlj4	it's possible something in /etc went kaboom during your upgrade
2013-10-21 06:47:44	aicasn	no data actually goes out, i don't think. they just don't work. i plugged in a usb-to-serial adapter and it is working fine, but it's not a good solution; i need the on-board ports to function. they work 100% under linux & windows xp embedded.  thanks
2013-10-21 06:48:19	mmlj4	sounds like a driver issue, aicasn
2013-10-21 06:48:27	aicasn	agreed

2013-10-21 08:17:28	mauriez	aicasn: more like "pass in quick on $ext_if proto { icmp6, tcp, udp } from any to any port 53

2013-10-21 08:19:46	aicasn	icmp doesn't do ports the same way tcp/udp does. icmp does "types"
2013-10-21 08:20:05	mauriez	i know.. so would this rule fail.. or would the port be ignored?
2013-10-21 08:20:19	mauriez	and would all icmp traffic be allowed

I have followed the handbook on setting up the master server, but when i add a user on that server (after stting up everything), and run "make nis-domain" in /var/yp, the new user wont get added to /var/yp/master.passwd. Do i need to manually copy entries into /var/yp/master.passwd or is something wrong on my side?

2013-10-21 11:45:39	rEv9	I'm currently using 1 ufs disk with some stuff on, and just bought another one. can I create a zpool mirror on the new one, copy everything I from the old one and then add that to the zpool? I want them in a zpool mirror without loosing the data on the first disk I'm currently using
2013-10-21 11:46:00	rEv9	or do I have to add two discs at the same time to create a zpool mirror?

2013-10-21 11:49:03	lattera	you can add a new new disks to mirrors at any time
2013-10-21 11:49:25	trout	I think you would need to copy the data to the zfs disk and then add the ufs disk to the mirror (redone as a zfs disk)
2013-10-21 11:49:28	lattera	I just did it the other day because one of my drives in the mirror died

2013-10-21 11:50:44	lattera	rEv9: this is what you'd do: 1) create new zpool with the single disk; 2) replicate data to it; 3) destroy partitioning on ufs disk (maybe not necessary); 4) add ufs disk as a mirror vdev to the zpool

2013-10-22 02:03:04	Kapsel	I am experiencing something that seems like a bottleneck somewhere in my system. I have a FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE box with ~100 2TB SAS drives configured in 2-way mirrors, 1TB SSD and a pool the pool is performing very well. I share my files using netatalk, and netatalk works by generating a local database (on my server) which is kept up-to-date with the filesystem, for performance.
2013-10-22 02:03:17	Kapsel	however, when this database is being generated, i.e. reading folders that has not been read before, the process will be very very slow, and I see this in `top`
2013-10-22 02:03:20	Kapsel	25814 root             1  20    0 89028K 14100K zio->i 20   0:32  1.27% afpd
2013-10-22 02:03:21	xmj	it's the 14->15 standards problem all over, i bet.
2013-10-22 02:03:35	Kapsel	zio->i <- which I guess means that it's waiting for ZFS. I did a truss on the afpd process, and I see that it's doing a lot of stat's or individual reads to every file in the folder. the folders sometimes contains 100.000 files, and it looks like it can read maybe a couple of hundred of files per second, which makes it very very slow.
2013-10-22 02:03:40	xmj	"we'll make one standard that'll unify all others."
2013-10-22 02:03:56	ghoti	It's no surprise.  Different distributions have different "favourite" tools, too.  I mean, since Ubuntu 8.04, there have been three different recommended syslog daemons.
2013-10-22 02:04:01	Kapsel	The pool is doing absolutely nothing when this is going on, theres close to no io on the individual disks (looking at gstat/iostat), and theres plenty of room everywhere to do something like this.
2013-10-22 02:04:22	Kapsel	Is my filesystem throttling the many small reads somehow?

2013-10-22 02:08:47	ghoti	I've recently been dealing with filesystem performance problems at a much MUCH smaller scale -- three web servers in jails on different hardware, all of which started performing really badly -- like 20+ seconds to respond -- starting at 3:01 AM.  For me, turns out that staggering `periodic daily` and removing servers from the load balancer while it runs was the best I could do.
2013-10-22 02:09:26	Kapsel	i see the individual disks doing 1 iops when doing this, in average - when I have other read/write loads, they often do in excess of 200.

2013-10-22 07:19:36	boru	aicasn; how are you sure that no data is ever sent through the port? Did you try other baud rates? It's unlikely, but it might not like that baud rate. Try 115K and so on. Does power cycling fix it? I've had problems with PLX PCI-UARTs showing similar symptoms.
2013-10-22 07:20:26	boru	aicasn; and try toggling other settings like handshaking, flow control etc. minicom will allow you to do all of that.
2013-10-22 07:21:03	boru	If you had a logic analyser or an oscilloscope, you'd have a few more options.
2013-10-22 07:22:35	r3boot	D4rkSilver: I've got multiple VPN gateways (running on debian squeeze+wheezy/ipsec-tools-0.8.0), and I just added a FreeBSD 10-BETA1+ipsec-tools-0.8.1 setup in the mix. I'm using transport-mode tunnels. From the three tunnels that terminate on the FBSD box all establish correctly (I have correct SA's on both sides). However, when sending traffic over the tunnels, only the packets that traverse the first tunnel will arrive (eg, ping works only for ...
2013-10-22 07:22:41	r3boot	... the first tunnel). I can see the ESP packets being transferred, and they end up on the other side of the tunnel, however, the other side will not reply

I'm using transport-mode tunnels. From the three tunnels that terminate on the FBSD box all establish correctly (I have correct SA's on both sides). However, when sending traffic over the tunnels, only the packets that traverse the first tunnel will arrive (eg, ping works only for the ...
2013-10-22 09:06:59	r3boot	... first tunnel). I can see the ESP packets being transferred, and they end up on the other side of the tunnel, however, the other side will not reply.

2013-10-22 18:20:32	subdue	thinking make is the issue is like saying the port maintainers knows nothing about freebsd
2013-10-22 18:20:35	_op_	try this on 6-9-STABLE and on 10-STABLE and 11-CURRENT:

2013-10-23 00:16:23	Prock81	tangentstorm what i just mention is better than whereis, do the above with k3b and do a where is with k3b and ull see why
2013-10-23 00:16:42	risc	if you want to search tangentstorm be sure to check out psearch
2013-10-23 00:17:01	risc	got the nice output

2013-10-23 00:17:04	risc	just like that
2013-10-23 00:18:05	Prock81	risc before i bother with psearch, how much different is the output from make search name=
2013-10-23 00:18:29	tangentstorm	yikes.. make search is a bit overwhelming :)
2013-10-23 00:18:43	Prock81	tangentstorm really !?
2013-10-23 00:18:58	tangentstorm	well the first thing i thought to search  for was j, so... :)
2013-10-23 00:19:06	risc	Prock81: it's a lot less typing ;)
2013-10-23 00:19:08	Prock81	and i thought i was the one that should get picked on in here

2013-10-23 00:20:05	tangentstorm	hmm.. i'd say 'psearch lazarus' is definitely an improvement over 'make search name=lazarus', and you don't have to be in any particular diroctory.
2013-10-23 00:20:25	tangentstorm	thanks IAmTheClaw and risc
2013-10-23 00:20:34	risc	or how about I log on to 1 of my sparc64 boxes and run make search key for you on OpenBSD so you can test that too?

2013-10-23 04:55:52	r3boot	Commander1024: in my experience (9.1/9.2) the virtio drivers in ports caused interface lockups during high packet rates; those issues seem to be solved with 10.x

2013-10-23 06:14:17	TobiasTheViking	i'm having an issue with firefox. I've installed it from ports with only "OPTIMIZED_CFLAGS" and "ALSA" enabled. Whenever i launch firefox it will use all my memory(and 24gigs of swap), and then it will be killed.

2013-10-23 06:15:21	TobiasTheViking	i haven't been able to find anything usable on google. And i can't really comprehend why firefox would instantly try to use 24+ gigs of memory

Also, FF is known for it's very heavy memory requirements, especially when using flash and other dynamic websites (although your issue sounds more like a memleak)

2013-10-23 06:18:07	r3boot	2gb ram for a browser instance which is just started is way, WAY too much memory ;)
2013-10-23 06:18:23	TobiasTheViking	i haven't tried with a pkg_add, i could give that a go(though i'm loathe to do that). But it sounds like i could also just wait for a new version and see if it goes away

2013-10-23 16:08:17	IRCsloth	with advanced format drives you have to create a gnop device to get 4k blocks but how do you do that with HAST? I can create my hast devices using the gnop vdevs but those don't persist across reboots. Is there a way to specify 4k alignment with HAST devices?

2013-10-23 16:19:15	IRCsloth	nox-: so the issue is that these drives with out gnop are showing as ashift 9 (512k). When I create the HAST device (/dev/disk0) which is /dev/da0.nop on both hosts I get an ashift 12 pool. the problem is that I can't really use .nop devices as the vdevs for the HAST config because they're not persistant.
2013-10-23 16:19:24	EVBB-Eugene	frogs i've tried ro
2013-10-23 16:19:57	IRCsloth	I wonder if the trick would be to create the HAST device using /dev/da0 and then gnop the device HAST creates before building the zpool
2013-10-23 16:21:44	AllanJude	hold on
2013-10-23 16:21:49	AllanJude	you are doing ZFS on top of HASH?
2013-10-23 16:21:57	AllanJude	er HAST
2013-10-23 16:22:04	AllanJude	ZFS only sets the ashift @ pool creation
2013-10-23 16:22:12	AllanJude	so, you do the gnop once, and you never need it again
2013-10-23 16:22:21	AllanJude	if you are not using ZFS, there is no ashift
2013-10-23 16:22:35	AllanJude	EVBB-Eugene: exactly what are you trying to mount
2013-10-23 16:22:57	AllanJude	IRCsloth: yes, gnop the device you GIVE to zpool, and you only need to do it during zpool create

2013-10-23 20:58:55	wkennington	probably ethernet
2013-10-23 20:59:15	trout	wkennington: I mean, given either of those scenarios
2013-10-23 20:59:19	IAmTheClaw	there are a bunch of protocols for network
2013-10-23 20:59:21	IAmTheClaw	pick one
2013-10-23 20:59:22	trout	what tool / protocol should I use?
2013-10-23 20:59:32	wkennington	well, nfs is built in
2013-10-23 20:59:35	davidhoude	ftp?
2013-10-23 20:59:43	IAmTheClaw	rsync, sftp, ftp, nfs, smb, http
2013-10-23 20:59:45	trout	so, that implies forming a network between the two
2013-10-23 20:59:52	trout	I was hoping for something like "treat remote disk like a hdd"
2013-10-23 20:59:56	davidhoude	yes
2013-10-23 21:00:02	davidhoude	like a mac

2013-10-23 21:00:19	trout	davidhoude: okay
2013-10-23 21:00:26	trout	so its: "go with the obvious"
2013-10-23 21:00:32	davidhoude	I'd go for the ethernet, card should auto switch pins, no need for switch
2013-10-23 21:00:52	trout	I was wondering if it was different for having a direct connection vs going over the interwebs
2013-10-23 21:01:00	trout	<wkennington> so im pretty sure my ports are completely broken and have no idea what to do. I'm getting errors about missing bsd.port.mk and such ---> do you use portsnap or svn?

2013-10-23 21:01:37	trout	true
2013-10-23 21:01:54	IAmTheClaw	i use smb because it's convenient on for my windows laptop

2013-10-23 21:06:45	trout	ah
2013-10-23 21:07:02	trout	was hoping to do this with my current hardware
2013-10-23 21:07:19	nycat	or if you have an eSata port, you could use that if you get a cable that has both esata and normal sata connectors on it
2013-10-23 21:07:33	davidhoude	iscsi isnt difficult to configure
2013-10-23 21:07:42	davidhoude	per your earlier question
2013-10-23 21:07:51	nycat	trout: you could try HAST
2013-10-23 21:08:25	nycat	or nbd
2013-10-23 21:08:26	trout	nycat: I have an eSata port
2013-10-23 21:08:33	trout	davidhoude: I will try iScsi
2013-10-23 21:08:36	trout	mostly to learn about it
2013-10-23 21:08:43	trout	nycat: HAST requires both sides to be FreeBSD :(
2013-10-23 21:08:49	trout	also, its quite long term
2013-10-23 21:10:00	nycat	trout: what is the other side?
2013-10-23 21:10:13	trout	nycat: a mac in this case
2013-10-23 21:10:18	trout	but I want to keep my question general
2013-10-23 21:11:27	davidhoude	I'd love a solution similar to apple's
2013-10-23 21:11:40	davidhoude	while not very secure, its really awesome if you have to maintain a large # of systems
2013-10-23 21:11:47	davidhoude	without having to open anything ever

2013-10-24 02:42:08	Borg	if not whatever. it can be run other ways.

2013-10-24 07:22:43	bounce	ports will know
2013-10-24 07:22:46	xmj	Benkinooby: that depends on the version.
2013-10-24 07:22:59	Benkinooby	xmj: 2.7

2013-10-24 09:54:03	r3boot	PRabyte: once you found your curl instances, compare the paths where they are located and compare that to the order of $PATH. Once you found the difference (it's in the ordering), you can do two things: 1) fix the path in /etc/profile or 2) rename /usr/bin/curl to something else and symlink the new one into place (albeit that's really ugly).

2013-10-24 12:56:09	ooonak	Is it possible to "access" a tun interface on the host, from indside a jail? My goal is to set default gwateway thrue tun interface for jail only.
2013-10-24 12:56:45	AllanJude	ooonak: you can recompile your kernel with VIMAGE etc, which lets you fully virtualize networking in the jail, then you use epair interfaces

2013-10-24 21:41:39	ganthore	AllanJude, I had to alter the directions on the BSD wiki. Most of the steps related to how you configure the boot loader.
2013-10-24 21:42:38	ganthore	So I used `gpart bootcode -b /boot/mbr ada0` instead of 'gpart bootcode -b /boot/boot0 ada0' as documented here: https://wiki.freebsd.org/RootOnZFS/ZFSBootSlice
2013-10-24 21:43:21	ganthore	And then the boot1 stage worked fine so no mods were needed: dd if=/boot/zfsboot of=/dev/ada0s1 count=1

2013-10-25 06:12:04	D4rkSilver	mjrosenb: one ports tree

2013-10-25 06:12:57	mjrosenb	ok, and we just cross our fingers and hope libc provides a consistent enough abstraction over all kernels to make this work?
2013-10-25 06:13:30	mjrosenb	and/or packages can say 'I really don't work on freebsd-5, why would you even try that?'

2013-10-25 06:14:20	D4rkSilver	And also you have compatibility for older FreeBSD on newer versions
2013-10-25 06:14:26	mjrosenb	Krzysiek__: did you set the bits in the kernel, that let jails speak to the network?
2013-10-25 06:14:47	mjrosenb	D4rkSilver: i'm thinking of things like new /proc entries, etc.
2013-10-25 06:14:51	cardiel	is there a boot loader who support freebsd(zfs) and windows server?
2013-10-25 06:15:11	Krzysiek__	mjrosenb, i think so, since my jails are able to connect to the outside network, and outside network can connect to jails

2013-10-25 06:16:27	mjrosenb	frogs: that was the first thing that came to mind.  the point is newer software is well within its rights to expect the kernel to provide things that were not provided in the past.
